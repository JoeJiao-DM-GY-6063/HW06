# PM2.5 Data Visualization
This project visualizes the PM2.5 levels in Beijing using a simple data visualization built with p5.js. The data is read from a CSV file containing monthly PM2.5 values, and the visualization represents these values as ellipses, where the size of each ellipse corresponds to the pollution level.
The script loads the Beijing-PM2.5.csv file, which contains PM2.5 data for each month.
Each month is mapped to a horizontal position on the canvas, and the PM2.5 value determines the size of the ellipse for that month.
